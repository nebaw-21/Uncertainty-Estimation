Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to implement the entire project using GitHub Copilot in VS Code. This guide assumes you have:

VS Code installed with the GitHub Copilot extension enabled (and a valid Copilot subscription).
Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended).
Necessary Python extensions in VS Code: Python (by Microsoft), Jupyter (by Microsoft).
Required libraries installed via pip: pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy (TensorFlow/Keras for the MLP, scikit-learn for the dataset, and others for data handling and viz). If you prefer PyTorch instead of TensorFlow, adjust prompts accordingly, but I'll stick to TensorFlow/Keras as it matches the "Dense" layer syntax in the project description.
A basic understanding of how to use Copilot: In VS Code, open a file (e.g., a Jupyter notebook .ipynb or Python .py file), type a comment prompt starting with # or a docstring, and let Copilot auto-complete the code. Press Tab to accept suggestions.

The guide is structured as sequential steps. For each step:

I'll tell you what to do in VS Code.
Provide a Copilot prompt (a comment or code snippet you type to trigger Copilot's generation).
Explain what to expect and any manual tweaks.

We'll implement everything in a Jupyter Notebook for easy execution and visualization, but follow the suggested folder structure. The notebook will handle code, metrics, and plots. For the report, we'll create a Markdown file that you can convert to PDF (e.g., via VS Code's Markdown PDF extension or pandoc).

Step 1: Set Up Project Structure in VS Code

Open VS Code.

Inside current folder, create subfolders:

data/ (empty for now; dataset is loaded from scikit-learn).
models/ (for model scripts).
methods/ (for method implementations).
results/ (for saved plots).
report/ (for the final report).


Step 2: Create the Main Jupyter Notebook


In VS Code, right-click the root folder > New File > Name it uncertainty_estimation.ipynb.


Open the file (it should open in Jupyter mode).


Add initial cells: Use Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run cells as you go.
Copilot Prompt (type in the first Markdown cell):
text# Uncertainty Estimation in Tabular Regression
## Using MC Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Temperature Scaling on Boston Housing Dataset
Copilot may suggest completing the header with objectives—accept if it matches the project.
In the next code cell, we'll start importing libraries.



Step 3: Import Libraries and Load Dataset


In the notebook, add a new code cell.


Copilot Prompt (type this comment in the cell):
text# Import necessary libraries: tensorflow for models, sklearn for dataset and metrics, pandas/numpy for data, matplotlib/seaborn for plots

Copilot should generate: import tensorflow as tf, from tensorflow.keras import layers, models, from sklearn.datasets import load_boston, etc.
Manually add if missing: import pandas as pd, import numpy as np, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, import seaborn as sns, from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, from scipy.stats import norm.



Add another code cell for data loading.
Copilot Prompt:
text# Load Boston Housing dataset from sklearn, convert to DataFrame, split into features (X) and target (y), then train-test split (80/20), standardize features

Expected output: Code to load load_boston(), create X = pd.DataFrame(...), y = ..., X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(...), and scale with StandardScaler.
Add a validation split if needed: After train-test, split train into train/val (e.g., 80/20 of train) for temperature scaling.
Run the cell to load data (506 samples, 13 features).

Tweak: Ensure random_state=42 for reproducibility.



Step 4: Define the Base MLP Model (in models/simple_mlp.py)


Create a new Python file: Right-click models/ > New File > simple_mlp.py.


Open it.


Copilot Prompt (at the top):
text# Define a simple feed-forward MLP using Keras: Input -> Dense(32, ReLU) -> Dropout(0.2) -> Dense(16, ReLU) -> Dense(1)
# Compile with MSE loss, Adam optimizer
# Include a function to build the model
def build_mlp(input_shape):

Copilot should generate the model: model = models.Sequential([...]), model.compile(...).
Add Dropout with rate=0.2-0.3, keep it for MC Dropout.



Back in the notebook, import it:
Copilot Prompt in notebook cell:
text# Import the build_mlp function from models/simple_mlp.py
from models.simple_mlp import build_mlp



Step 5: Train the Base Model


In the notebook, add a code cell.


Copilot Prompt:
text# Build the MLP model with input shape from X_train
# Train on X_train_scaled, y_train for 100 epochs, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2
# Plot training history (loss and val_loss)

Expected: model = build_mlp(X_train.shape[1]), history = model.fit(...), plt.plot(history.history['loss']), etc.
Evaluate on test: predictions = model.predict(X_test), compute MSE, RMSE, R².

Run and tweak epochs if overfitting (use EarlyStopping if Copilot suggests).



Step 6: Implement MC Dropout (in methods/mc_dropout.py)


Create methods/mc_dropout.py.


Copilot Prompt:
text# Function for MC Dropout inference: Take a model with dropout, perform N=30 stochastic forward passes on input data
# Return mean prediction and standard deviation (uncertainty)
# Use tf.keras.backend.set_learning_phase(1) or enable dropout manually
def mc_dropout_predict(model, X, n_samples=30):

Copilot should generate: Loop over model.predict(X) N times (with dropout active), compute np.mean and np.std across predictions.
Note: In Keras, use model(X, training=True) in a loop for dropout during inference.



In notebook:
Copilot Prompt:
text# Import mc_dropout_predict from methods/mc_dropout.py
# Train a model with dropout
# Get MC Dropout predictions on X_test: means, stds = mc_dropout_predict(model, X_test_scaled)
# Compute metrics: MSE between means and y_test, average interval width (1.96 * stds)



Step 7: Implement Deep Ensembles (in methods/deep_ensemble.py)


Create methods/deep_ensemble.py.


Copilot Prompt:
text# Function to train K=5 independent MLPs with different random seeds
# Return list of trained models
def train_ensemble(X_train, y_train, k=5, epochs=100):

# Function for ensemble inference: Predict with all models, return mean and std across ensemble preds
def ensemble_predict(models, X):

Expected: Loop to build/train K models, then for predict: Stack predictions, np.mean(axis=0), np.std(axis=0).



In notebook:
Copilot Prompt:
text# Import train_ensemble and ensemble_predict from methods/deep_ensemble.py
# Train ensemble on X_train_scaled, y_train
# Get ensemble means and stds on X_test
# Compute same metrics as MC Dropout
Measure training time with import time; start = time.time(); ...; print(time.time() - start).



Step 8: Implement Temperature Scaling (in methods/temp_scaling.py)


Create methods/temp_scaling.py.


Copilot Prompt:
text# Function for temperature scaling: Optimize scalar T on validation set to calibrate variances
# Assume inputs are logits (but for regression, use Gaussian assumption: mean and var from MC/Ensemble)
# Minimize negative log likelihood (NLL) for Gaussian: Use scipy.optimize to find T that scales var / T
from scipy.optimize import minimize
def temperature_scale(means_val, vars_val, y_val):

For regression: Assume predictions are Gaussian (mean μ, variance σ²). Scale σ²_temp = σ² / T.
Optimize T to minimize NLL: sum log(σ_temp) + (y - μ)^2 / (2 σ_temp^2).
Copilot may generate using minimize on a loss function.



In notebook:
Copilot Prompt:
text# Import temperature_scale from methods/temp_scaling.py
# Get uncalibrated means/stds from MC Dropout or Ensemble on validation set
# Compute T = temperature_scale(means_val, stds_val**2, y_val)
# Apply to test: scaled_stds = stds / np.sqrt(T)
# Re-compute interval coverage (e.g., check if |y_test - means| < 1.96 * scaled_stds covers ~95%)
Use val set from earlier split.



Step 9: Evaluation Metrics and Comparison


In notebook, add cells for metrics.


Copilot Prompt (for accuracy):
text# Function to compute MSE, RMSE, R2 given y_true and y_pred
def compute_accuracy_metrics(y_true, y_pred):


Copilot Prompt (for uncertainty):
text# Compute Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP): Fraction where |y - mean| <= 1.96 * std
# Mean Prediction Interval Width (MPIW): Average 2 * 1.96 * std
def compute_uncertainty_metrics(y_true, means, stds, confidence=0.95):


Copilot Prompt (for calibration):
text# Generate calibration plot: For probabilities 0-1, bin expected vs observed coverage
# Use reliability diagram for regression intervals


Copilot Prompt (for table):
text# Create a pandas DataFrame comparing methods: Rows for MC Dropout, Ensemble, Temp Scaled; Columns for MSE, RMSE, R2, PICP, MPIW, Train Time, Infer Time
Run and populate with results.



Step 10: Visualizations


In notebook:


Copilot Prompt (prediction vs true):
text# Scatter plot: y_test vs means, with error bars ±1.96*stds for each method
# Save to results/prediction_vs_true.png


Copilot Prompt (uncertainty hist):
text# Histogram of stds for MC Dropout
# Save to results/uncertainty_hist.png


Copilot Prompt (calibration):
text# Reliability diagram: Plot expected coverage (x) vs actual coverage (y) for intervals at different levels
# After temp scaling, show improved line closer to y=x
# Save to results/calibration_plot.png
Use plt.savefig('results/...').



Step 11: Computational Cost Analysis


In notebook:


Copilot Prompt:
text# Measure and print training/inference time for each method using time.time()
# Discuss trade-offs in a Markdown cell
Add Markdown cells for discussion as per project.



Step 12: Create the Report


Create report/analysis.md (Markdown file).


Copilot Prompt (type in the file):
text# Project Report: Uncertainty Estimation on Boston Housing

## Methods Implemented
- MC Dropout: ...
- Deep Ensembles: ...
- Temperature Scaling: ...

## Results
| Method | MSE | RMSE | R2 | PICP | MPIW | Train Time | Infer Time |
|--------|-----|------|----|------|------|------------|------------|

Copilot will fill in structure—paste in your actual numbers/plots from notebook.
Add sections for Analysis, Observations matching the project table.
Embed images: ![Calibration Plot](../results/calibration_plot.png)



Convert to PDF: Install "Markdown PDF" extension in VS Code, then right-click the MD file > Export to PDF.



Final Tips

Run the notebook incrementally; debug any errors (e.g., shape mismatches).
If Copilot generates wrong code, refine the prompt (e.g., add "for regression task").
Total time: 1-2 hours if Copilot cooperates.
Test on CPU; dataset is tiny.
If stuck, search X/web with tools if needed, but for code, Copilot should suffice.
Once done, zip the folder as deliverable.

This covers the full project! If you need tweaks, ask.
